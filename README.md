# Multi-Threaded-Hangman-Client

Me and a classmate coded a Hangman game to guess a word in three categories: US States, Pets, and Colors. This is the server part of the project. This code is intended to serve as a server to establish a connection with a client user. The server receives and responds back to user interactions with the game. Using Threads it creates multiple games per user at the same time communicating with the Server independently.
